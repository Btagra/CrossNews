# Project-1

## About
Primarily a crossword app, which can display almost all of the puzzles published by the New York Times since Jan 1st 1977 by accessing the [open source archive](https://github.com/doshea/nyt_crosswords) maintained by @doshea. The information associated with each puzzle is stored as a JSON object and can be queryed via the pseudo-API at the following URL:

 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doshea/nyt_crosswords/master/#{year}/#{month}/#{day}.json
 
 Our app also:
- Prints a NYT headline for a given date using the [NYT API](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
- Display weather info using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev)
- Adds the current date horoscopes from an [astrology API](https://www.horoscopes-and-astrology.com/api)

There are a number of other potential features to be added once this primary task is completed. Namely:
- Show optional crossword hints using [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/)
- Add sudoku puzzles
